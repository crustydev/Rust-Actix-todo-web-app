# Rust-Actix-web
Follow-long code for Rust Web Programming book by Maxwell Flitton

I make no claim to the code in this repo being self-invented. It is simply follow-along code for the examples included in the book. 
The aim is to get myself used to writing code using Rust and the Actix framework while getting used to git for project management.
