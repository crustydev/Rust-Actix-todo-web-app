# Rust-Actix-web
Follow-along code for Rust Web Programming book by Maxwell Flitton

I make no claim to the code in this repo being self-invented. It is simply follow-along code for the todo web application example included in the book. 
The aim is to get myself used to writing code using Rust and the Actix framework while getting used to git for project management.

The code is littered with comments intended for personal recollection and understanding only. It might not necessarily be the right conclusion.
